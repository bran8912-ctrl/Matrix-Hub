# Deploy MTX Token to Amoy Testnet

This guide walks you through deploying the MTX token contract to Polygon Amoy testnet.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Get Amoy test MATIC

You need Amoy MATIC to pay for gas fees:
- Visit: https://faucet.polygon.technology/amoy/
- Or: https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/polygon-amoy
- Request test MATIC for your deployer wallet address

### 2. Get Polygonscan API Key

**Required for contract verification:**

1. Go to https://polygonscan.com/myapikey
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Click "Add" to create a new API key
4. Name it (e.g., "Matrix Hub Deployment")
5. Copy the generated API key

**Note**: The same API key works for both Mainnet and Amoy Polygonscan.

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your values:

```env
# Your deployer wallet private key (WITHOUT the 0x prefix)
# ⚠️ Use a burner wallet with only test MATIC, not your main wallet!
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_without_0x

# Amoy RPC URL (default provided, or use your own)
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology/

# Polygonscan API key for contract verification
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key_here
```

**Security Reminder:**
- ✅ `.env` is already in `.gitignore` - never commit it
- ✅ Use a burner wallet for deployment
- ✅ Keep your API keys secret

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2: Compile Contracts

```bash
npm run compile
```

This compiles the Solidity contracts and generates artifacts.

### Step 3: Deploy to Amoy

```bash
npm run deploy:sepolia
```

This will:
1. Connect to Amoy testnet
2. Deploy the MatrixHubCoin contract
3. Mint 100M MTX to the owner address: `0x9fb4bb44d8d962d695fc93b3dc15f1b287391077`
4. Save deployment info to `deployments/mtx-sepolia.json`

**Expected output:**
```
Starting MTX Token Deployment to Amoy testnet...
Network: sepolia
Deploying with account: 0xYourDeployerAddress
Account balance: 1.0 MATIC

Deployment parameters:
- Initial Supply: 100000000 MTX
- Initial Owner: 0x9fb4bb44d8d962d695fc93b3dc15f1b287391077
- Token Name: MatrixHubCoin
- Token Symbol: MTX
- Decimals: 18
- Network: Amoy (Chain ID: 80002)

Deploying MatrixHubCoin contract...

✅ MTX Token deployed successfully!
Contract Address: 0xYourContractAddress
Contract Owner: 0x9fb4bb44d8d962d695fc93b3dc15f1b287391077
Transaction Hash: 0xYourTxHash
Block Number: 12345

📄 Deployment info saved to: deployments/mtx-sepolia.json

📋 Next Steps:
1. Verify contract on Polygonscan:
   npx hardhat verify --network sepolia 0xYourContractAddress "100000000" "0x9fb4bb44d8d962d695fc93b3dc15f1b287391077"

2. Update src/config/mtx.ts with the contract address:
   address: "0xYourContractAddress"

3. Add liquidity to QuickSwap (MATIC/MTX pair)

4. Test the contract thoroughly before announcing

🔍 View on Polygonscan: https://amoy.polygonscan.com/address/0xYourContractAddress
```

**SAVE THE CONTRACT ADDRESS!** You'll need it for verification and configuration.

### Step 4: Verify Contract on Polygonscan

After deployment, verify the contract to make it publicly readable:

```bash
npm run verify:sepolia 0xYourContractAddress "100000000" "0x9fb4bb44d8d962d695fc93b3dc15f1b287391077"
```

Replace `0xYourContractAddress` with your actual deployed contract address.

**What verification does:**
- Makes contract source code publicly readable on Polygonscan
- Enables users to interact with contract directly on Polygonscan
- Builds trust by showing the contract matches the source code
- Allows Polygonscan to properly decode transactions and events

**Expected output:**
```
Successfully submitted source code for contract
contracts/MatrixHubCoin.sol:MatrixHubCoin at 0xYourContractAddress
for verification on the block explorer. Waiting for verification result...

Successfully verified contract MatrixHubCoin on Polygonscan.
https://amoy.polygonscan.com/address/0xYourContractAddress#code
```

### Step 5: Update Configuration

Update `src/config/mtx.ts` with your deployed contract address:

```typescript
export const MTX = {
  address: "0xYourActualContractAddress", // ✅ Your Amoy contract address
  symbol: "MTX",
  decimals: 18,
  Chain ID: 80002, // Amoy testnet
  chainName: "Amoy",
  // ... rest of config
};
```

### Step 6: Test the Deployment

1. **View on Polygonscan**: Visit the Polygonscan URL from the deployment output
2. **Check Contract**: Verify the contract shows as verified with green checkmark
3. **Check Balance**: Confirm initial owner has 100M MTX tokens
4. **Test Transactions**: Try reading contract values on Polygonscan

## Troubleshooting

### "Error: private key missing"
- Make sure `PRIVATE_KEY` is set in `.env`
- Private key should NOT include the `0x` prefix
- Example: `PRIVATE_KEY=1234567890abcdef...` (64 characters)

### "Error: insufficient funds"
- Get more Amoy test MATIC from a faucet
- Deployment typically costs 0.01-0.05 test MATIC

### "Cannot download compiler"
- This happens when Hardhat can't reach the internet
- If artifacts already exist, you may be able to deploy anyway
- Otherwise, check your internet connection and try again

### "Polygonscan verification failed"
- Make sure `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
- Verify the API key is valid (check https://polygonscan.com/myapikey)
- Wait 1-2 minutes after deployment before verifying
- Ensure constructor arguments match exactly: `"100000000"` and `"0x9fb4bb44d8d962d695fc93b3dc15f1b287391077"`

### "Error: already verified"
- Contract was already verified successfully
- You can view it on Polygonscan

## Network Information

### Amoy Testnet
- **Chain ID**: 80002
- **Currency**: Amoy MATIC (test MATIC)
- **RPC URL**: https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology/
- **Block Explorer**: https://amoy.polygonscan.com/
- **Faucets**: 
  - https://faucet.polygon.technology/amoy/
  - https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/polygon-amoy

### Contract Details
- **Name**: Matrix-HubCoin
- **Symbol**: MTX
- **Decimals**: 18
- **Initial Supply**: 100,000,000 MTX
- **Initial Owner**: 0x9fb4bb44d8d962d695fc93b3dc15f1b287391077

## After Deployment

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Contract appears on Amoy Polygonscan
- [ ] Contract is verified (green checkmark)
- [ ] Initial owner has 100M MTX balance
- [ ] Can read contract values on Polygonscan
- [ ] Token shows correct name, symbol, decimals
- [ ] All contract functions are visible on Polygonscan

### Next Steps for Production
1. Test all contract functions thoroughly on Amoy
2. Test wallet integration with Amoy contract
3. Test buying MTX with test MATIC
4. Once confident, deploy to Mainnet using `npm run deploy:mainnet`
5. Add liquidity to QuickSwap after mainnet deployment

## Important Notes

- **Never commit your `.env` file** - it's protected by `.gitignore`
- **Use a burner wallet** for deployment, not your main wallet
- **Test on Amoy first** before deploying to mainnet
- **Save your contract address** immediately after deployment
- **Verify on Polygonscan** to build trust and enable public interaction
- **Keep your Polygonscan API key secret** - treat it like a password
