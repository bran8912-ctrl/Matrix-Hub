# Matrix Hub – MTX Casino Overview

The Matrix Hub Casino is a community-owned game layer powered by [MTX](MTX_Whitepaper.md).

It is not a traditional casino.
It is an ecosystem [utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_token) designed to circulate value, reinforce [liquidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity),
and provide [provably fair](MTX_Casino_Provably_Fair.md) entertainment.

## Core Principles
- MTX is a [utility token](MTX_Tokenomics.md)
- No profit guarantees
- No private ownership
- Transparent math
- Sustainable liquidity reinforcement

Casino activity strengthens the MTX ecosystem rather than extracting value.
